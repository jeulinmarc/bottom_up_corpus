"""Map Estonia Äriregister (RIK) bulk-CSV elements to our curated concepts.

Consumes one report's ``elements`` map produced by
:func:`bottom_up_corpus.registers.ee_csv.iter_ee_reports` — ``{et_gaap_name:
float}`` where each key is a *standalone* Estonian-GAAP element name (the
``*Consolidated`` variants are already dropped upstream) — and produces the same
shape as the BE/FI/NO siblings: ``{period_end, basis, currency, values,
suppressed, unbalanced}`` with ``values[key] = {"value", "unit", "label",
"tag"}``. ``basis`` is ``"company"`` (RIK standalone statutory accounts); the
currency is EUR.

GOVERNING PRINCIPLE — NO FALSE DATA. This is open data for the credit universe:
a number we cannot confirm must never be emitted; a *missing* number is strictly
better than a *wrong* one. So every value below is either its confirmed,
directly-tagged figure or it is suppressed with a recorded reason.

Two Estonian traps drive the mapping:

* **The net-income trap.** The Estonian P&L waterfall runs
  ``TotalProfitLoss`` (operating result / *ärikasum*) →
  ``TotalProfitLossBeforeTax`` (pretax / *kasum enne tulumaksustamist*) →
  ``TotalAnnualPeriodProfitLoss`` (the FINAL result for the year /
  *aruandeaasta kasum*, **after** income tax). ``net_income`` is ALWAYS
  ``TotalAnnualPeriodProfitLoss`` — **never** the operating ``TotalProfitLoss``
  nor the pretax ``TotalProfitLossBeforeTax``. Mapping either earlier line would
  be a materially false net-income, so the three lines go to three distinct keys
  (``operating_income`` / ``pretax_income`` / ``net_income``) and are never
  conflated.

* **Leverage is liabilities-based.** The RIK bulk carries no borrowings line, so
  ``short_term_debt`` is mapped to ``CurrentLiabilities`` and ``long_term_debt``
  to ``NonCurrentLiabilities``. The engine's ``total_debt`` is then
  ``CurrentLiabilities + NonCurrentLiabilities`` and ``debt_to_equity`` is a
  liabilities-based (not borrowings-based) ratio.

The confidence gate (§4 of the design doc):

* **Company-template guard.** The RIK bulk mixes for-profit and NGO/non-profit
  templates. An NGO report has no ``Assets``/``Equity`` (it uses
  ``LiabilitiesAndNetAssets`` / ``NetSurplusDeficitForPeriod`` instead); mapping
  it into the company schema would emit mislabelled figures. So when either
  ``Assets`` or ``Equity`` is absent we treat the report as **no-financials**
  (empty values, ``unbalanced=False``, reason recorded) rather than guess.
* **Primary balance.** ``Assets == Equity + CurrentLiabilities +
  NonCurrentLiabilities`` within ``tol = max(2, 0.005·|Assets|)`` (absent
  liability buckets count as 0 — a zero-debt filer). Mismatch → the whole filing
  is untrustworthy: ``unbalanced=True``, emit NO values (a wrong balance sheet is
  worse than none).

Always suppressed (record reasons): ``interest_expense`` and
``interest_coverage`` — the RIK bulk contains no interest / borrowings element at
all, so a coverage ratio can never be produced from this source.
