    Parameters
    ----------
    mapped:    The concept-mapper output (must have ``unbalanced``; may have
               ``values`` / ``suppressed``).
    entity_id: National identifier; the table key and the accession/lei subject.
    lei:       Resolved LEI (or None). The ``lei`` column falls back to
               ``_lei_or_none(entity_id)`` when the entity_id is itself a LEI (the
               DK-FSA case) — a no-op for every register whose entity_id is a
               national number.
    name:      Company name for the summary; ``name or entity_id`` is used.
    cov_base:  Producer-specific coverage identity (e.g. ``{"be_number": …}``).
    country:   ISO-2 country for the RowBase.
    source:    Row ``source`` tag AND the summary ``sec_form`` (equal for every
               single-period register).
    form:      Accession prefix — ``f"{form}-{entity_id}-{period_end}"`` — usually
               ``== source`` but distinct for UK (``"ch"`` vs ``"companies_house"``).
    leverage_basis:  ``"borrowings"`` / ``"total_liabilities"`` / None — stamped
               onto the leverage-derived rows (see :func:`_emit_entity_rows`).
