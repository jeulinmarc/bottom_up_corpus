"""Map Belgium BNB CBSO dimensional-XBRL facts to our curated concepts.

Consumes the flat fact list produced by
:func:`bottom_up_corpus.registers.bnb_xbrl.parse_bnb_data_xbrl` — each item
``{"dims": {dim_local: member_local}, "value": float, "unit": str}`` — and
produces the same shape as the CH/UK sibling
(:func:`bottom_up_corpus.registers.concepts_uk.map_ch_facts`):
``{period_end, basis, currency, values, suppressed, unbalanced}``, where
``values[key] = {"value", "unit", "label", "tag"}``.

GOVERNING PRINCIPLE — NO FALSE DATA. This corpus is open data for the credit
universe: a number we cannot confirm must never be emitted; a *missing* number
is strictly better than a *wrong* one. So we suppress anything ambiguous and
record the reason.

The BNB instance is *dimensional* (EBA/DPM-style): every monetary fact is a
generic metric qualified by its context's dimension members. Meaning lives in
the members — ``bas`` (rubric: m25 balance-sheet total, m37 equity, m50 total
liabilities, m51 financial borrowings, m53 turnover, m59 net result…), ``part``
(m1 assets, m3 equity&liabilities, m4 income statement), ``prd`` (m1 current,
m2 prior). Other dims (``ntr`` nature, ``rst`` maturity, ``typ``, ``sts``,
``spec``, ``mdp``…) *disaggregate* a total. So the dimensional risk is picking a
disaggregated fact instead of the total: e.g. ``m59/m4 spec=m16`` is *pre-tax*
result (54.4M) while the breakdown-free ``m59/m4`` is the real net result
(115.9M). Every curated value must be the unambiguous total, or suppressed.

Canonical-member selection. For a key ``(bas, part, required-members)`` we take
the fact whose ``dims == {bas, part, prd:m1} ∪ required`` and carries **no other
dimension** (breakdown-free), with a EUR unit. If 0 or >1 such fact exists the
total is not unambiguously identifiable -> suppress the key.

The confidence gate (§4 of the design doc):
- **Primary:** total assets (``m25/m1``) must equal the total passif
  (``m25/m3``) — both independently tagged — within tolerance. Mismatch -> the
  whole filing is untrustworthy: ``unbalanced=True``, no values.
- **Financial debt** (real borrowings — the rich payoff): the ``m51`` tranche
  sum, emitted only when an INDEPENDENT witness reconciles (the financial-nature
  slice of total liabilities, ``m50[ntr=m3]`` — a *different* rubric). If they
  do not reconcile, or the tranche structure deviates, the borrowings figure is
  unconfirmable -> suppress the block (fall back to liabilities-based leverage
  rather than emit a possibly-wrong number). Emitted ATOMICALLY (both halves).
- ``operating_profit`` (m44) is always suppressed — label ambiguous on the one
  validated real filing, pending a 2nd real example.
