"""Map UK Companies House (FRC-taxonomy) iXBRL facts to our curated concepts.

Consumes a ``flatten_oim_json`` flatten — ``{local_name: [point, ...]}``, each
point ``{"val","end","unit","tag",...}`` — keyed by the concept's **local name**
(the FRC namespace year varies across filings, so we never key on the full QName).
Produces the same ``{period_end, basis, currency, values}`` shape as the NO
sibling (:func:`bottom_up_corpus.registers.concepts_no.map_brreg_entry`), plus a
``suppressed`` audit trail and an ``unbalanced`` flag.

GOVERNING PRINCIPLE — NO FALSE DATA. This corpus is open data for hedge funds: a
number we know is wrong must never be emitted; a *missing* number is strictly
better than a *wrong* one. So we prefer directly-tagged values, derive only from
structural anchors, and emit a derived value only when its inputs are present AND
a confidence gate passes — otherwise we suppress it and record the reason. We
never default a missing balance-sheet item to zero.

The confidence gate (independently-tagged anchors only):
- **Primary:** ``NetAssetsLiabilities == Equity`` within tolerance. If they
  disagree the whole filing is untrustworthy -> ``unbalanced=True``, no values.
- **Anchor:** when ``FixedAssets`` is tagged, verify
  ``TotalAssetsLessCurrentLiabilities == FixedAssets + NetCurrentAssets``; on
  mismatch the inputs are proven inconsistent, so EVERY derived balance item
  (assets, liabilities, liabilities_current, short/long-term debt) is suppressed
  — the P&L and directly-tagged equity/cash still stand.
- **Completeness:** the derived liability/debt block is emitted atomically, only
  when BOTH the current (``CA − NCA``) and long-term (``TALCL − NetAssets``)
  halves are derivable; if only one is, the whole block is withheld so the
  engine's ``total_debt`` is never silently understated.

``assets`` is derived from ``TotalAssetsLessCurrentLiabilities + current
liabilities`` (a robust structural anchor) rather than ``FixedAssets +
CurrentAssets`` — ``FixedAssets`` is frequently *untagged* (dimensioned away),
which would silently UNDERSTATE assets = a false number.
