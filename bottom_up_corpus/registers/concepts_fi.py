"""Map Finnish PRH dimensional-XBRL facts to our curated concepts.

Consumes the current-period field map produced by
:func:`bottom_up_corpus.registers.fi_prh_xbrl.parse_fi_facts` —
``{"period_end", "currency", "fields": {mcy_int: float}}`` where each key is the
Finnish ``fi_MC:xNNN`` metric code — and produces the same shape as the BE/UK/NO
siblings: ``{period_end, basis, currency, values, suppressed, unbalanced}`` with
``values[key] = {"value", "unit", "label", "tag"}``. ``basis`` is ``"company"``
(FAS individual accounts); the currency is EUR.

GOVERNING PRINCIPLE — NO FALSE DATA. This is open data for the credit universe:
a number we cannot confirm must never be emitted; a *missing* number is strictly
better than a *wrong* one. So every value below is either its confirmed,
directly-tagged figure or it is suppressed with a recorded reason.

Two Finnish traps drive the gate:

* **The net-income trap.** Under Finnish GAAP (FAS) the P&L routes tax through
  *appropriations* (``x541``), so the final bottom line is ``x740``
  (``result after appropriations``), **never** ``x738`` (``result before
  appropriations``): ``x740 = x738 + x541``. We map ``net_income`` to ``x740``
  and verify a two-leg waterfall — if either leg fails we suppress ``net_income``
  rather than fall back to ``x738``.

* **The maturity-label trap (leverage).** ``x583`` and ``x816`` split total
  liabilities (``x513``) by maturity and reconcile to it to the cent, but the
  PRH instance carries **no label linkbase** — the taxonomy that names which
  bucket is long-term vs short-term is external and not shipped with the filing.
  So *which of ``x583``/``x816`` is long vs short cannot be confirmed from the
  data*. Emitting a guessed ``long_term_debt``/``short_term_debt`` split would be
  a false maturity claim, and mapping the whole of ``x513`` into a single bucket
  asserts an equally-false "all one maturity" label. Per NO-FALSE-DATA we
  therefore **suppress the maturity split** (``long_term_debt``/``short_term_debt``)
  entirely — never guess which is long vs short. FI emits ``liabilities`` (``x513``)
  as a raw reported value but produces **no** ``total_debt``/``debt_to_equity``
  (the engine's leverage ratios require the suppressed split). A future authoritative
  codelist confirming the assignment would re-enable the split under the existing
  ``x583 + x816 == x513`` gate.

The confidence gate (§4 of the design doc):

* **Primary balance:** ``x360 == x435 + (x513 or 0)`` (assets == equity +
  liabilities) within tolerance. Mismatch → the whole filing is untrustworthy:
  ``unbalanced=True``, no values.
* **Assets decomposition:** ``x376 + x424 == x360`` (``x376`` non-current assets
  **may be negative** — housing companies — so there is no positivity check).
  On mismatch the two asset components are suppressed (the gate-verified total
  ``x360`` still stands).
* **P&L waterfall (two legs):** Leg 1 — when both ``x12`` (net financial items)
  and ``x738`` are present: ``|x689 + x12 − x738| ≤ tol``; failure suppresses
  ``net_income``. Leg 2 — when ``x738`` is present: ``|x738 + (x541 or 0) −
  x740| ≤ tol``; failure suppresses ``net_income``. When ``x738`` is absent both
  legs are skipped and ``x740`` is emitted directly. Never ``x738``.

Always suppressed (semantics unconfirmed under FAS): ``income_tax`` (tax is
routed through appropriations, not a clean line), ``cash`` (``x438`` ambiguous),
``financial_debt`` (no reliable bank-borrowings vs trade-payables split), and
``provisions`` (no confirmed code).
