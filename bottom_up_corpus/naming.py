"""Point-in-time issuer naming.

A company's CIK is permanent, but its *name* changes (Facebook -> Meta, Google ->
Alphabet restructuring, countless mergers). EDGAR records this history in the
submissions API under ``formerNames``:

    "formerNames": [{"name": "Facebook Inc",
                     "from": "2005-05-06T04:00:00.000Z",
                     "to":   "2021-10-27T04:00:00.000Z"}]

This module resolves the name **in effect on a given filing date**, so a 2015
filing is attributed to "Facebook Inc" rather than the current "Meta Platforms,
Inc.". The current name is kept separately for search/joins.
