"""Completeness matrix: downloaded vs. expected per issuer / form / year.

Parallels ``cb_corpus.completeness``. Central banks have fixed publication
calendars; SEC issuers have a deterministic cadence only for a few periodic
forms (one 10-K and three 10-Qs per fiscal year, one annual proxy). Everything
else (8-K, 6-K, registrations, ownership) is event-driven, so its expected count
is *unknown* and the matrix reports presence rather than a target.

Status per (cik, form, year) cell:
    ok       discovered >= expected, or expected unknown but discovered > 0
    partial  0 < discovered < expected
    missing  expected > 0 but discovered == 0
    unknown  expected unknown and discovered == 0
