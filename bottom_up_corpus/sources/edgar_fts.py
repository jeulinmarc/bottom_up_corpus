"""Reverse CUSIP -> CIK resolution via EDGAR full-text search (EFTS).

Given a bond's CUSIP, find the SEC filing that lists it and take that filer's
CIK. The search is **restricted to issuer offering forms** (424B / FWP / S-3):
an unrestricted CUSIP search ranks fund *holders* (N-PORT / 13F) first, not the
issuer, so the restriction is what makes the top hit trustworthy.

Network unit: one GET per CUSIP, fair-access throttled via the shared Fetcher.
``edgar_fts`` is an anticipated provenance value in ``models.py``.
