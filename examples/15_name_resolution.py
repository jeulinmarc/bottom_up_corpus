"""Resolve company names to CIKs via the SEC cik-lookup-data.txt index.

The current ticker map lists only *trading* issuers, so delisted/renamed members
don't resolve by ticker. The name tier matches on a strict canonical name against
the SEC's full name->CIK file (former names included), and breaks a name borne by
two companies using their dated formerNames. Fully offline (a tiny inline index).
