"""Build the S&P 500 as a *historical union* (not just today's members).

`issuers_from_sp500(start=...)` reconstructs membership from Wikipedia (current table
+ the dated changes table), so the result is every company that was a member over the
window — with `first_seen`/`last_seen` dates — not survivorship-biased on selection.
Run (hits Wikipedia):
