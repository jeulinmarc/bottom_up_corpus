"""Resolve EU issuers to their GLEIF LEI — by ISIN and by name.

EU identity is the GLEIF Legal Entity Identifier (+ the issuer's ISINs) — the EU
analog of the SEC CIK. ``resolve_entities`` records HOW each one resolved (the
``resolution`` tier: lei / isin / isin-figi / name / unresolved), and an ambiguous
name is left unresolved rather than guessed. Network (GLEIF).
