"""Print the EU coverage catalog — backends, Euronext markets, doc-type taxonomy.

A fully OFFLINE tour of what the EU pillar covers: the national `COUNTRY_BACKENDS`
map (country -> OamSource), the `EURONEXT_MICS` markets the Euronext complement
reaches, and the controlled `DOC_TYPES` vocabulary with the `DOC_FAMILY` that maps
each to its on-disk family folder. Adding a country = one row in COUNTRY_BACKENDS.
