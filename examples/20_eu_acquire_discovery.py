"""Acquire one issuer end-to-end in DISCOVERY mode (dispatch + dedup, no download).

`acquire(..., download=False)` resolves the entity, runs every applicable backend
(national + filings.xbrl.org + Euronext complement + listing fallback), de-duplicates
across them, and writes the coverage report — but downloads no files. Use it to
*size* a run before committing the bytes. Flip to `download=True` to fetch the files
into `data/raw/<LEI>/<FAMILY>/<year>/` (Catana is ~257 docs / ~290 MB, so leave it
False for a quick demo). Network; writes only the entity index + coverage report.
