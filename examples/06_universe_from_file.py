"""Build a universe from a CSV of identifiers (the credit-universe path).

`reconcile_identifiers` resolves each row by authority **CIK > CUSIP6 > ticker**:
an explicit CIK wins; otherwise ticker->CIK and CUSIP6->CIK must agree, and when
they DISAGREE it's a collision (a recycled ticker pointing at a different company
than the bond's CUSIP6 — e.g. DT->Dynatrace, not Deutsche Telekom).

This demo is fully offline (a hand-built ticker map + crosswalk); in real use the
ticker map comes from `load_company_tickers(fetcher)` and the crosswalk from a
`cik,cusip6` CSV passed as `--crosswalk`. Run:

    ./venv/bin/python examples/06_universe_from_file.py
