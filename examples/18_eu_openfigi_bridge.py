"""The OpenFIGI ISIN->LEI bridge — resolve issuers GLEIF's ISIN filter misses.

GLEIF's ISIN->LEI mapping is incomplete: it can hold an issuer's LEI yet not its
equity ISIN, so a plain `filter[isin]` lookup returns nothing. On that miss,
`resolve_entities` bridges ISIN -> OpenFIGI issuer name -> GLEIF (binding only on a
single normalised match) and tags the result `resolution="isin-figi"`. These two
Irish bank ISINs typically resolve *only* thanks to that bridge. Network.
